        <p>One of the most well-known hypothesis tests, the t-test is used to assess the equality of two statistics. In this case we are testing the equality of two population statistics (typically means) based on samples from those populations. More specifically, this test is used when:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You have two separate sets of samples. E.g. a treatment group and a control group, not a before and after treatment comparison ("paired samples").</li>
            <li>You want to assess if a treatment led to some measureable difference in the groups (e.g. giving the treatment group a low fat diet led to a reduction in average weight).</li>
            <li>You do not know the population standard deviation(s). If you do, you can instead use a <i>z</i>-test.</li>

        <p>When conducting a t-test with two independent samples, the following assumptions are made about your data:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Your data consists of two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically-distributed_random_variables" target="_blank">independent and identically distributed</a> samples, one from each of the two populations being compared.</li>
            <li>The sample means (<span style="text-decoration:overline;"><i>X</i></span><sub>1</sub> and <span style="text-decoration:overline;"><i>X</i></span><sub>2</sub>) are normally distributed.<sup>1</sup></li>
            <li>The sample variances (<i>s</i><sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> and <i>s</i><sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub>) are Ï‡<sup>2</sup> distributed.<sup>2</sup></li>
            <li>The sample means and sample variances are statistically independent.</li>
            <li>This calculator does not require the groups to have equal variance as it uses the Welch's unequal variances t-test formulation by default<sup>3</sup></li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>[1] This does not require your underlying data to be normally distributed. With larger samples, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem" target='_blank'>Central Limit Theorem</a> typically means the sample means will be normally distributed.</p>
        <p>[2] This assumption holds if the underlying data are normally distributed, but not neccessarily if you are relying on the Central Limit Theorem for normally distributed sample means.</p>
        <p>[3] <a href='https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2015/01/always-use-welchs-t-test-instead-of.html' target='_blank'>You probably should be doing this too</a>.</p>
